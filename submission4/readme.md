1). The 'Code' folder contains the code that we have run. The file also has the PCAs of the data. We haven't included the data itself to protect the privacy of the data donors.

2). The file "Report_Final_Group_9.pdf" is the report of the project we did. It has the description of the models that we implemented and their results.
