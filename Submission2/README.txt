1) EM.m
This is the user defined function for Expectation Maximisation

2)EM_Test.m
This is a simple testing script for regenerating an image matrix using the EM Algorithm (EM.m)

2)EM_Test.m
This is a simple testing script for regenerating a corrupted image matrix using the EM Algorithm (EM.m)

3)EM_Missing.m
This is the user defined function for Expectation Maximisation for rengenerating an image matrix with missing entries.

4)EM_Test_Missing.m
This is a simple testing script for regenerating an image matrix with missing various number of missing entries using the EM Algorithm (EM_Missing.m)

5)PPCA.m
This is the user defined function for PPCA without EM

6)PPCA_Test.m
This is a simple script testing the PPCA.m function for regenerating an image matrix using PPCA

NOTE: PPCA.m and PPCA_Test.m are initial scripts, the final ones are the EM scripts.
