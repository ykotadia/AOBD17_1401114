This code implements deep convolutional neural network on mnist dataset and writes entire tensorflow graph generated in backend to /nn_logs_graphs/ folder for visualising in tensorboard.

Accuracy is 98.62 % which is better than simple neural network analysis which gave around 92 %.

Dependencies for running the code
	Python
	Tensorflow Framework in python 

Before running the code just change the directory to your local directory in line 85 of code where it writes tensorflow graph to local machine.
 
For running the code enter the following command
	--------------------
	| python deepMNIST.py |
	----------------------

All the results generated are kept in /results/ folder.
